# 19CS406-EX-1 STUDY OF SOCKET PROGRAMMING WITH CLIENT-SERVER MODEL
# DATE :09-03-2023
# AIM :
To implement socket programming date and time display from client to server using TCPSockets

# ALGORITHM :
# Server:

1.Create a server socket and bind it to port.

2.Listen for new connection and when a connection arrives, accept it.

3.Send server‟s date and time to the client.

4.Read client‟s IP address sent by the client.

5.Display the client details.

6.Repeat steps 2-5 until the server is terminated.

7.Close all streams.

8.Close the server socket.

9.Stop.
# Client:
1.Create a client socket and connect it to the server‟s port number.

2.Retrieve its own IP address using built-in function.

3.Send its address to the server.

4.Display the date & time sent by the server.

5.Close the input and output streams.

6.Close the client socket.

7.Stop.
# PROGRAM :
# CLIENT:
```
import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',8000))
s.listen(5)
c,addr=s.accept()
address={"165.165.80.80":"6A:08:AA:C2","165.165.79.1":"8A:BC:E3:FA"};
while True:
 ip=c.recv(1024).decode()
 try:
 c.send(address[ip].encode())
 except KeyError:
 c.send("Not Found".encode())
 ```
# SERVER:
```
import socket
s=socket.socket()
s.connect(('localhost',8000))
print(s.getsockname())
print(s.recv(1024).decode())
s.send("acknowledgement recived from the server".encode())
```

# RESULT:
Thus, the program to implement socket programming date and time display from client to server using TCP Sockets was successfully executed.
